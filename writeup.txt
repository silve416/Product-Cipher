Question 1: Why are the encrypted versions (lines 2 and 4) of gettysburg.txt so much harder to compress than the plaintext version (line 6)?

The encrypted version is not only larger, but contains a much larger spread of inputs meaning it is harder to simplify and therefore harder to compress the file.

Question 2: Why is the gettysburg.aes.gz larger than gettysburg.enc.gz, and even larger than gettysburg.aes? What does that suggest about the difference in entropy between AES's output and our product cipher's output?

AES has less information density than our product cipher meaning it will have a smaller outpu.

Question 3: Does the encrypted file size depend on the key used? Why or why not?

No, the key size is irrelecant because the key is looped every key is essentially the same "size" for encryption.

Question 4: Does the encrypted-and-compressed file size depend on the key used? Why or why not?

No, for the same reason the regular size isn't affected by the key size.

Question 5: Does the ratio of the encrypted-and-compressed file size vs. the encrypted-only file size depend on the input file (e.g., abe vs.  moby_dick)? Why or why not?

Yes, the larger the file the larger the compressed and/or encrypted size.
